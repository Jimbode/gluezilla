	* Makefile.am: include windows.mak in EXTRA_DIST

2007-11-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* windows.mak: embed manifest file in a release build so windows 
	actually loads dependencies correctly

2007-11-09  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: Disable event calls on OnStateChange, it's unstable

2007-11-08  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: When loading, invoke events on the managed side
	so it can track progress and url changes.
	* gluezilla.h, Widget.h: remove unneeded events, fix parameters.
	* interfaces.h: add nsIURI interface, OnLocationChanged needs it
	* Widget.cpp: add StateChange and LocationChange implementations to
	call up to the managed side.

2007-11-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* windows.mak: windows makefile for command line building with nmake
	* gluezilla2k5.vcproj: add release configuration, finetune settings

2007-11-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Disable debug messages when enable-optimize=yes (non-debug build)
	* gluezilla.*: add access to the WebNavigation object, for future 
			direct interface access

2007-11-05  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* LocationProvider.*, Widget.cpp: GRE_GetXPComPath() searches for a 
	runtime with a fixed version equal to the one it was built against,
	so only use it to search for a local runtime, and if it fails, use
	GRE_GetPathWithProperties() to get a runtime with a version >= 1.8,
	independently of whatever version it was initially built with.

2007-10-31  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.*,Widget.h: Receive user data dir to store local data.
	* LocationProvider.cpp: Use the user data dir for component and xpti
	registry. Use the mozilla directories to load plugins and other shared
	mozilla things. No need to use local directories anymore.

2007-10-30  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.*, Widget.*: add blur entry point to catch
	when the webbrowser control loses focus

2007-10-18  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add missing headers to EXTRA_DIST

2007-10-18  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Widget.cpp: fix pointer cast for 64-bit arch, fix asynch 
	return value

2007-10-07  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Implement helper methods for the nsString class, to 
	initialize/destroy nsString instances and get/set the actual
	chars.
	All dom interface methods that have string parameters
	take a nsString class, which comes from these helper
	methods.
	Change the exit to really quit the gtk thread.
	Add dom interface support.

2007-09-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Implement dialog popups through the custom 
	PromptService - alert, alertcheck, confirm,
	confirmcheck, confirmex, prompt, promptpassword,
	promptusernameandpassword, select
	Fix event naming.
	BrowserWindow is now an interface, don't know if
	that is to keep.

2007-09-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* add enumeration to control focus
	* remove blur method (not needed)
	* fix bad parameter on gtk_shutdown

2007-09-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* GtkWidget.cpp: Fix keyboard handling
	* Widget.*, xulbrowser.*: 
		- setup shutdown routines
		- do a bit more logging, prepare for non-debug builds

Mon Aug 20 19:45:18 CEST 2007 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Widget.cpp: set the parent earlier in CreateBrowserWindow ().

2007-08-09 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* LocationProvider.*: Custom directory service
	implementation to control where profiles, defaults
	and components are loaded, and where the component
	registry is saved. This is so that components can
	be loaded from the xulrunner lib path but the 
	registry is saved to the application dir.
	
	Saving and loading profiles from the application
	dir also enables https, since it needs to save 
	and load	the cert.db and similar files somewhere 
	or else https is not initialized 
	(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309877)
	
	* BrowserWindow.*: Navigation control. Page reloading.
	
	* Widget.*: Custom GRE startup to use the custom
	directory service provider (LocationProvider) instead
	of the default provider.
	Implement more events.
	
	* xulbrowser.*: Initialize library with application
	dir (might come in handy later). Navigation control
	

2007-07-30 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Implement custom prompt and security dialog service
	  components.
	  Implement mouse, key and focus handlers and callbacks.
	  Implement Focus and Activation management.
	  Setup generic event callback (for monitoring)
	  Separate ns* interface includes

2007-07-21 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>
	
	* Implement IEmbeddedSiteWindow for sizing and title
	support. Implement resizing. Normalize width and height.
	Fix casts.
	Add vstudio 2005 project

2007-07-05 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Clean up/reduce ifdef clutter/remove duplicate code 
	on the gtk-related portions by invoking a "delegate" 
	to call methods on the widget - the delegates handle 
	the gtk stuff generically so things are nice and 
	shiny and non-duplicated all over the place.
	
2007-07-04 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Fix the navigate method; use the embedded string api
	through nsEmbedString; add an empty debug call just to
	force load the library and to make it easier to debug

2007-07-04 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp, BrowserWindow.h, xulbrowser.h: 
	Change the include paths of non-frozen interfaces to use
	the xulrunner-devel package tree.

2007-06-25 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: 
	- Apart from a few changes in variable 
	naming (out with the prefixes, eek), add initializations 
	for session history and window creator. 
	- When on gtk, get the native	mozilla widget that is the 
	real drawing surface (not used for now, might come in handy
	later).
	- Save the current uri in the object so it can be	reloaded 
	later (overload to the Navigate method).
	- Add a lot of debug printlines (gtk only).
	- Add implementation of nsIWindowCreator's CreateChromeWindow 
	(this is gtk only as far as I can tell, windows does not 
	need this, and xlib toolkit probably doesn't, either).

	* BrowserWindow.h: normalize includes and variable naming, 
	add extra Navigate overload and uri 
	getters/setters.
	
	* gtkWidget.cpp/h: Inherit it from window so it can be
	self-suficient. Add a new window signal (not used yet).
	Add a new constructor so it can also use a normal gtk window
	as parent instead of a XID.
	
	* Widget.cpp/h: Add initialization of AppShell. This is 
	absolutely required for the browser widget to work on 
	linux, and is not mentioned *anywhere*. <grrrr>
	Add thread support on linux/gtk (this gtk widget code
	should go somewhere else...)
	
	* xulbrowser.cpp/h: Add thread to run the gtk main loop, 
	and reroute all requests on linux/gtk to that thread so 
	that things actually *work*.
	New params class to help pass parameters to the gtk gui
	thread.
	
2007-06-22 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gtkWidget.cpp, gtkWidget.h: a custom gtk widget
	to feed to mozilla (just on linux). It takes
	a native window handle on construction, so
	it bootstraps onto an existing X window instead
	of requiring a top level gtk window.
	
	* Change browser init sequence on linux to call
	the gtk_main loop, catch the expose event on the
	widget and create the browser there, raising
	an OnWidgetLoaded event when done. On Windows, do
	everything normal but also raise the OnWidgetLoaded
	event.
	The OnWidgetLoaded signals that initialization is done.
	Start catching events on the browser (at least on windows,
	still no luck getting it to show up on linux)

2007-06-18	Andreia Gaita	<avidigal@novell.com>

	* initial checkin.
