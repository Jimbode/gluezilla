If you want to run make here to extract the headers from the idl files
on windows, you will need to add in this directory the following dlls:

* glib-1.2.dll
* libIDL-0.6.dll

These files are part of Mozilla's build tools for Windows:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/source/wintools.zip
