A simple library to embed Gecko (xulrunner) for the Mono Winforms
WebControl.

The Mono.Mozilla and xulbrowser are the current working directories.

xulbrowser - c/c++ library bridge for xulrunner
Mono.Mozilla - Managed wrapper
tests/browser - test app

Building
========

	Since Mozilla has changed quite a bit across various versions
	and the way that it has been packaged and its APIs differ from
	one version to another you will need to tune your setup
	according to your OS.


Platform: SUSE Linux Enterprise 10
==================================

	Before starting, make sure you install the 
	following packages and any dependencies they
	may have:

		mozilla-nspr-devel
		mozilla-xulrunner-devel	

	Invoke configure like this:

		./autogen.sh [--enable-optimize=yes]
		
	The --enable-optimize flag will enable -O2, if =no it will use -g3
	instead.

Testing
=======

	Once you have build and installed the software, go to:

		cd tests/browser
		
	Before running the test app, you will need the standard xulrunner
	folders here:
	
		chrome/
		components/
		defaults/
		greprefs/
		plugins/
		res/
		
	You can copy these from build/xulrunner. Wherever you copy them from,
	remove any components/*.dat files
	
	Then run
	
		mono test.exe
